1. Make sure you are in the folder ".../movies/src"
2. Run the following command: "javac *.java"
3. Execute the main class (is within movie class): "java Movie"
4. Observe the output


There shouldn't be any package related issues, however if you encounter any, try running the main class from the outer-most folder while having the path on the command line for example "java movies/src/Movie"
